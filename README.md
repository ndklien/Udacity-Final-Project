# Sparkify Final Project
Sparkify is a digital music service similar to Spotify and Youtube Music. Users may add friends or songs to their playlists, subscribe, listen to their favorite music for free (with adverts) or for money,...

In this project, we will use Spark to modify large, realistic datasets in order to design useful features for churn prediction. To create machine learning models with huge datasets, we'll utilize Spark MLlib.

## Instructions
The code is saved in ```.ipynb``` file and can be run with any tool that support this file format. These are libraries that is used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- warnings

## Results
For the code, please check the notebook ```Sparkify.ipynb```.
